## Project Overview
This project explores the earnings of top athletes across sports, countries, and time using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Key Insights
- Athlete earnings are heavily right-skewed, driven by a small number of extreme outliers.
- Basketball dominates appearances, while boxing produces the highest single-year earnings.
- Earnings have increased significantly over time, with a strong correlation between year and earnings (r = 0.65).
- Rankings alone do not explain earnings; endorsements and global marketability play a major role.

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
